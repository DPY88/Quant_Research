In this folder you will find sample strategies that demonstrate the project results. 
The reason for the strict rules in the backtesting is because the Topstep proprietary trading firm has a $50,000 account that allows for a maximum of $2000 drawdown at any point, and no compounding.

Strategy 1: EMA Strategy
- This strategy utilizes two assets: MNQ (Micro Nasdaq futures) and MES (Micro S&P 500 futures)
- The folder contains cumulative returns for MNQ and MES from 2019-2024, aswell as the statistics and trade list for MNQ since 2019.
  - The statistics and trade list do not account for fees as this comes directly from NinjaTrader. The Equity curve does account for trading fees.
- The folder also contains an Equity curve since 2008 demonstrating that this strategy has returned an average of 16% YoY returns across >1000 trades.
